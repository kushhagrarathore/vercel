## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @types/react @types/react-dom typescript react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers yup @dicebear/core @dicebear/avataaars --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Database Setup

Run the SQL commands in `database-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of database-schema.sql
```

This will create:
- `profiles` table for user profile data
- `user_stats` table for user statistics
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Triggers for automatic profile creation

### 3. File Structure

The implementation includes:

```
src/
├── types/
│   └── profile.ts              # TypeScript interfaces
├── services/
│   └── profileService.ts       # API service layer
├── utils/
│   └── avatarUtils.ts          # Avatar generation utilities
├── components/
│   ├── AvatarEditor.tsx        # Avatar customization modal
│   └── DeleteAccountModal.tsx  # Delete account confirmation
└── pages/
    └── Profile.tsx             # Main Profile page component
```

### 4. TypeScript Configuration

The `tsconfig.json` file is already configured for React + TypeScript.

### 5. Usage

The Profile page is accessible at `/profile` and includes:

- **Profile Section**: Main profile form with avatar customization
- **Account Section**: Account settings overview
- **Notifications Section**: Notification preferences
- **Privacy Section**: Privacy settings
- **Legal Sections**: Terms, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy
- **Account Actions**: Logout and Delete Account

### 6. Avatar Customization

Users can:
- Edit avatar appearance through a modal
- Randomize avatar with one click
- Copy avatar link to clipboard
- Customize hair, eyes, mouth, accessories, clothing, and colors

### 7. Profile Completion

The system automatically calculates profile completion based on:
- Name provided (20%)
- Email verified (20%)
- Avatar configured (20%)
- Quizzes taken/created (20%)
- Achievements earned (20%)

### 8. Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling includes:
- API call failures
- Form validation errors
- Network issues
- User feedback through toast notifications

### 9. Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- User can only access their own data
- Proper authentication checks
- Secure password updates

### 10. Performance

- Optimized re-renders with React hooks
- Efficient state management
- Lazy loading of components
- Proper TypeScript typing

## Customization

### Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes and can be easily customized by modifying the className props.

### Avatar Options
Avatar customization options can be modified in `avatarUtils.ts` by updating the arrays of available styles and colors.

### Profile Completion Logic
The completion calculation can be customized in `profileService.ts` by modifying the `calculateProfileCompletion` method.

### Database Schema
Additional fields can be added to the `profiles` or `user_stats` tables by modifying the SQL schema and TypeScript interfaces.

## Testing

1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to `/profile`
3. Test all functionality:
