# Live Quiz Application - Refactored Features

This document describes the newly implemented features for the live quiz application, which has been refactored to use the `lq_sessions` table as a single source of truth with a `phase` column controlling the application's state.

## 🎯 New Features Implemented

  - Highlights correct answers in green
  - Displays vote counts and percentages
  - Smooth animations using Framer Motion
  - Responsive design

- **Key Features**:
  - Smooth animated transitions between phases
  - Real-time session subscription

  - Enhanced user experience with Framer Motion

## 🔄 Quiz Phases

The application now uses a clear phase-based system:

1. **`lobby`** - Waiting for participants to join
2. **`question`** - Active question with timer
3. **`results`** - Showing poll results
4. **`leaderboard`** - Displaying current standings
5. **`ended`** - Final results with podium

## 🎮 How to Use

### For Hosts (AdminPage):
1. Start a new quiz session
2. Share the QR code or session code with participants
3. Click "Start Quiz" to begin
4. Use the dynamic "Next" button to progress through phases:
   - "Start Quiz" → "Show Results" → "Show Leaderboard" → "Next Question" → "Finish Quiz"

### For Participants (QuizPage):
1. Enter session code and username
2. Wait in lobby for quiz to start
3. Answer questions within the time limit
4. View results and leaderboards
5. See final podium at the end

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### Dynamic Button States:
- **Lobby**: "Start Quiz" (green)
- **Question**: "Show Results" (disabled until timer ends)
- **Results**: "Show Leaderboard" (green)
- **Leaderboard**: "Next Question" or "Finish Quiz" (green)

### Smooth Animations:
- Page transitions using Framer Motion
- Animated progress bars for poll results
- Staggered animations for leaderboard entries
- Podium animations with delays

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The refactored system relies on these key tables:

### `lq_sessions`
- `phase`: Controls application state ('lobby', 'question', 'results', 'leaderboard', 'ended')
- `current_question_id`: Points to active question
- `timer_end`: ISO timestamp for question timer
- `is_live`: Boolean for active sessions

### `lq_live_responses`
- `selected_option_index`: Participant's answer choice
- `points_awarded`: Points earned for the answer
- `is_correct`: Boolean for correct/incorrect answers

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Replace existing files** (optional):
   ```bash
   # Backup current files
   cp src/pages/livequiz/AdminPage.js src/pages/livequiz/AdminPage.js.backup
   cp src/pages/livequiz/QuizPage.js src/pages/livequiz/QuizPage.js.backup
   
   # Use new refactored versions
   cp src/pages/livequiz/AdminPageRefactored.js src/pages/livequiz/AdminPage.js
   cp src/pages/livequiz/QuizPageRefactored.js src/pages/livequiz/QuizPage.js
   ```

2. **Update routing** (if needed):
   - Ensure routes point to the correct components
   - Test the new phase-based flow

3. **Test the features**:
   - Create a quiz with multiple questions
   - Start a live session
   - Join as a participant
   - Progress through all phases
   - Verify animations and real-time updates

## 🔧 Technical Details

### State Management:
- **AdminPage**: Writes all phase changes to database
- **QuizPage**: Subscribes to session changes and renders accordingly
- **Real-time**: Uses Supabase real-time subscriptions

### Performance Optimizations:
- Memoized fetch functions with `useCallback`
- Efficient re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Optimized animations with Framer Motion

### Error Handling:
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states for better UX

## 🎯 Next Steps

The refactored architecture provides a solid foundation for:
- Additional quiz types (true/false, image-based, etc.)
- More sophisticated scoring systems
- Enhanced analytics and reporting
- Multi-language support
- Advanced customization options

## 📝 Notes

- The refactored version maintains backward compatibility
- All existing functionality is preserved
- New features are additive and don't break existing code
- Database schema remains the same, just better utilized
